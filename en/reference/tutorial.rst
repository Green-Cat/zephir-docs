Zephir and this book are intended for PHP developers which wants to create C-extensions with a lower
complexity.

We assume that you are experienced in one or more other programming languages. We draw parallels to features
in PHP, C, Javascript, and other languages. If you know any of these languages, weâ€™ll point out
similar features in Zephir, as well as many features that are new or different.
