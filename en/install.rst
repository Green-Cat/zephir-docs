Installation
============
To install Zephir, please follow these steps:

Prerequisites
-------------

The Zephir compiler currently must be cloned from Github. Since Zephir is written in PHP you need to have
installed a recent version of PHP and it must be available in your console:

.. code-block:: bash

	[#] php -v
	PHP 5.5.7 (cli) (built: Dec 14 2013 00:44:43)
	Copyright (c) 1997-2013 The PHP Group
	Zend Engine v2.5.0, Copyright (c) 1998-2013 Zend Technologies

Also, make sure you have also the PHP development libraries installed along with your PHP installation:

.. code-block:: bash

	[#] phpize -v
	Configuring for:
	PHP Api Version:         20121113
	Zend Module Api No:      20121212
	Zend Extension Api No:   220121212

You don't have to necessarely see the exact above output but it's important that these commands are available to start
developing with Zephir.
